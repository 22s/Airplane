# Airplane

Performance orientated Bukkit implementation based off Tuinity.

## What do you do differently?
Our fork is made of optimizations for large servers. Whether you have a large amounts of players, entities, or chunks, we'll try to get them running smoothly on your server!

## How do I get support?
We currently require Discord for support, you can go to the #support channel and click the reaction on the only message in there. This will open up a new channel for you to talk directly with our support and development team. You can join the Discord by clicking this link: https://discord.gg/63dDSReB7j

## What kind of support do you provide?
We'll provide immediate support for configuring and setting up Airplane, as well as real-time support in diagnosing performance issues. If we need to optimize Airplane for a specific use-case, we can do that as well. If you need optimization of a plugin, our developer team is ready to take on any challenge!

## Will Airplane work with my plugins?
Airplane will work with any plugin that depends solely on either the Bukkit API or the Paper API. If the plugin uses direct server code, we'll try our best to maintain compatibility, but if we need to improve compatibility with any plugins just open a support ticket!
